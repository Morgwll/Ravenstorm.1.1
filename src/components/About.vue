    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Joseph Ortega, the author of the programming and the settings, is a Senior Front End Developer originally from Malaga, Spain, who lives in London, UK.</p>
    <p>With over 20 years of experience in tabletop RPGs and coming from a city that was once thriving in such activities, he has learned over the years of the nuances of different systems and editions, what made them good and what made them... not so good.</p>
    <p>Both having learned from Tabletop and Live Action RPGs he has Seen the industry rise, fall and rise again, and with the appearance of streaming shows like Aquisitions Inc, Critical Role, Harmonquest and Maze Arcana, this is the perfect point in time for this application to come and help those who still can't get on board hoist themselves in this incredible voyage that is tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
    <p>However, with the demand that is surging in recent years for groups to find that member that will take on the mantle, I found that sometimes the game systems and the cumbersome preparations for a game get in the way of a good story. The Mercer effect doesn't make things easier (bless Matt in all his glory) for novice Storytellers, so I am putting this application here to neutralize those extremely high expectations by taking an entirely different route.</p>
    <p>I thought that this is like a gateway to more fully fledged games like D&D. Some stepping stone for people who either have no time to sit and write an adventure, or prepare a retail module like Tomb of Annihilation.</p>

      <i>I am here to produce a system that will allow people to connect and tell stories together. Something for everybody to enjoy, regardless of their background, gender, religion, sexual orientation, political afiliations, age or culture. I believe the world will only get better when we treat each other as equal and these things are never a factor in order to make friends and enjoy our time together. There is such thing as a "too-high-horse" and it's just another pathway to vanity (incidentally, people like that lack the ability to reflect on themselves). And frankly... if our horses have such long legs we will never be further from each other.</i>

      <i>I am never going to get involved in identity politics. I made the algorythm in a way that about 50% of characters and creatures are male and the other 50% female and that is how they get randomly generated. There are no stat or skill differences between the two. I will never waste my time explaining myself about why some wording is in such orther or any other nuances, why I'm not writing about characters that decide they identify as a mortar spatula or why women are very scantly clad in sword and sorcery settings. My only answer is that in such settings, except in very civilised areas EVERYBODY is wearing very revealing outfits, regardless of gender. Wether you appreciate the male figure or it goes completely over your head is a different matter.</i>
